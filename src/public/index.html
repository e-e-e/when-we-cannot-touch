        <p>When we cannot touch, art is the object that passes between us:</p>

        <p>an art and correspondence project, with</p>

        <p>Susie Anderson, Beth Caird, Brain Fuata, Angela Goh, Susan Jacobs and Ella Sutherland,</p>

        <p>and a postscript by Charlie Sofo.</p>


        <p>‘When we cannot touch, art is the object that passes between us.’ This project draws inspiration from this
            recent
            observation by writer Olivia Laing and from ‘Mail Art’, a movement which began in the 1960s and which, over
            time, has taken a variety of forms: postcards, poems, drawings, collages, prints, faxes, emails and blogs. A
            means to communicate simply, and beyond more conventional means of exhibition or sale, the recipients are
            typically artists and other art-world inhabitants.</p>

        <p>A group of artists and writers have been invited to enter into an exchange with a known or fictional
            correspondent, and then share some aspect of this colloquy in two-dimensional form with a wider audience,
            via
            postal distribution.</p>

        <p>This offline, slow-time gesture of solidarity provides a means with which to come together when physical
            proximity is not possible. The act of receiving a letter in this digital age seems almost archaic, and yet,
            in
            these times of social isolation, this playful form of exchange provides a more personal means with which to
            connect, across time and space. When the pace of change—with one crisis and threat overwritten by the
            next—has
            made thinking, the act of making sense, nearly impossible, its simple proposition is to enrich the
            everyday.</p>
